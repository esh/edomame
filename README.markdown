#Introduction
I am currently using latte to power <http://www.edomame.com>, my personal website. To post a picture, I email the picture to my website. I can also do this programatically using it's REST interface.

Edomame is hosted on the google app engine but can also be deployed as a servlet or as a standalone web server.

#Dependencies
